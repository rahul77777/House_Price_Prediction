This data science project series explains how to create a real estate price prediction website step-by-step. Using the housing pricing information from Kaggle.com 
for Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, we will first construct a model using Sklearn and linear regression. The next step would be to create a Python Flask 
server that processes http requests using the saved model. The third element is a website made using html, css, and javascript that asks the python flask server 
for the anticipated price once the user enters information about their home's square footage, bedrooms, etc. 

During model building I have used data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for 
hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, etc.

This project addresses, in terms of technology and tools,
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
